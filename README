A project to be used as the starting point for a new iOS project

Includes 
MKNetworkKit	
Mogenerator (Arc and NSCoding support for model files)

Usage: 
Data persistance:
Define your model using core data UI - add entities and properties. (Any properties that you want to persist must have a data type that supports NSCoding).
Inverse relationships are not supported at this stage.
The objects are generated as .h and .m files when you run the Generate Data Model target. 
You will have to drag newly generated class files into your project from finder. Model files are placed in ./Model/ModelObjects in Human and Machine folders. 
You are supposed to modify the human files only! This is for adding custom methods to your model objects should you desire them.
An example might be adding an accessor method to your model object that returns and ordered array for that model object's NSSet property. You would add this to the Human/ClassName.h and .m files. your patterns are your own, so this is not necessary. Do what you want!
